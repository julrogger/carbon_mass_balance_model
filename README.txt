Model to calculate the atmosphere-ocean carbon mass balance over the last 390 Myr using reconstructions of topography and climate as boundary conditions and to test the effect of vegetation eco-evolutionary dynamics on carbon fluxes. 

To run the model: 
1) Create the model landscape for the biological model 
2) Define parameter space
3) Run the main model script -> currently coded to run chunks of the paramter space for use in parallel on a HPC cluster

Manuscript with more details currently in revision.
